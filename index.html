    <h2 class="sub">Are burgers sandwichs?</h2>
    <p> <del>yes  it is </del>          umm i meant  No it is not. A burger consists of a cooked “burger patty” between a bun or roll.

The buns are traditionally white sesame buns again, the variety is endless because brown, wholewheat, or other buns may also be used.      by:https://digitalprojects.voices.wooster.edu/2022/04/28/is-a-burger-a-sandwich/
